To run automatic test on sequ:

In the src/tests directory:
   -  test-list: contains arguments to be input into seq and sequ. This 
      generates files automatically named from the arguments.

   -  create-seq-files.sh. To be used as: 
      ./create-seq-files seq < test-list 
      ./create-seq-files ./sequ.py < test-list
      This generates files from seq and sequ.py, taking the arguments from
      test-list

   -  ./run-compare.sh seq ./sequ.py < test-list > test-results.txt
      This compares the test files and outputs whether each
      test passed for failed into "test-results.txt"

In some cases, the test "failed," but the failure exposed a bug in seq
instead of sequ. For example, seq -w 10 -.1 9.9 gives:
   10.0
   9.9

And sequ gives: 
   10.0
   09.9
