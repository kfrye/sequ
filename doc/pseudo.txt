sequ - Compliance Level 1

The initial draft will just be a script since it's very simple.
No functions involved yet.

Parse the arguments from the command line:
   There should be exactly two arguments ("first" and "last") and both 
   are integers

   If this is not the case, exit(1) (Failed)

If first > last
   exit(0) (Success)

If last - first > 100000000, exit(1) (Failed)

for i = first to i = last (inclusive)
   print i

exit(0) (Success)
