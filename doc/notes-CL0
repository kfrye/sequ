sequ - CL0 Notes
Homework 2

The 0th implementation of sequ takes two integers as arguments and
prints a sequence of numbers between them in increments of 1. Success
returns a 0. Failure returns a 1.

I'm going to need to know how to parse arguments, make sure those arguments
are integers, and print out a sequence of numbers.

_Parse Arguments_
http://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html has information on how
to parse command-line arguments

When argparse fails, it returns 2 instead of 1. To meet our specifications,
this needs to be overwritten. A technique for doing this using try/except is 
found in:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5943249/python-argparse-and-controlling-overriding-the-exit-status-code

_For/Range_
The syntax for using a for loop in Python with range can be found here:
