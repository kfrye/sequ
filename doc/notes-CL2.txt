CL2 Notes

Specs for CL2:

Compliance Level 2 of sequ adds additional convenience arguments for formatting.

The arguments that MUST be accepted are as follows:

-W, --words: Output the sequence as a single space-separated line. Equivalent to
"-s ' '".

-p, --pad : Output the sequence with elements padded on the left to be all of
equal width: the pad character is given by the single-char pad string .
Backslash-escapes in MUST be processed as in C printf(3).

Note that the "-w" command of level 2 is equivalent to "-p '0'".

-P, --pad-spaces: Output the sequence with elements padded with spaces on the
left to be all of equal width. Equivalent to "-p ' '".

---
-W is very similar to -s. I should be able to leverage existing code, although I
will probably need to put this functionality into a separate function or 
refactor entirely.

-p and -P are very similar to -w. Likewise, I should be able to leverage
existing code, but will need to refactor.

------

Main categories of printing:

-Equal-width (Must specify width and precision)

   -w: Pad to left and right with zeros.
   -p: Pad to left with specified symbol. Pad to right with zeros.
   -P: Pad to left with spaces. Pad to right with zeros.

-Separator (Must specify end character)

   -s: Separate with specified character
   -W: Separate with space

-Special formatting (Must print with user-specified format)

   -f: Use specified formatting

-Normal printing (Print with precision determined by get_max_precision)

I might need to break up print_output into smaller functions, but I will get the
new features working first and then look into re-factoring

Followup: I implemented the new features and it added about 10 lines of code to
my print_output function. I could separate this out into separate functions, but
I don't have any duplicate code and separating stuff out probably won't help me
with simplifying anything, so I'm going to leave it as is.
